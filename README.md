## Tech Stacks Used - 
1. React.js - UI 
2. Library Routing - react-router-dom
3. State Management - Redux-Toolkit (@reduxjs/toolkit)


## Project Overview
This project involves building a comprehensive React.js web application that demonstrates proficiency in both frontend development and state management techniques. The application will consist of multiple components, including authentication capabilities, content display, and user interaction features.

## Core Features and Requirements
1. **Login Page**: Create a login form with robust form validation. The form should handle user input efficiently and provide feedback for validation errors.
2. **Sign-Up Component**: Develop a sign-up form with necessary validations ensuring data integrity and user feedback.
3. **Home Component**: Includes a Header, Main Section, and Footer.
    - **Header Component**: Displays a logo and navigation menus that facilitate easy user movement across different sections of the application.
    - **Main Component**: Implements features such as favorite feeds, collections, and a client feedback section. Each element should have an interactive UI.
4. **Contact Us Component**: Design this with a form that also includes comprehensive form validators.
5. **Authentication Components**: Implement state management to ensure that components like Home, Main, and Contact Us are accessible only after user authentication.
6. **Navigation**: Use React Router for navigating between components seamlessly.
7. **Component Architecture**: Demonstrate the use of both class components and function components within the application. Implement examples of traditional function syntax as well as arrow functions for handling logic and state.

## Additional Enhancements (Good to Have)
- **Styling**: Employ one or more CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, or Bootstrap to enhance the applicationâ€™s aesthetics.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application displays beautifully and functions well on devices of various sizes (mobiles, tablets, laptops, desktops).
